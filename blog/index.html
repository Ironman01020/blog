                    Golconda Fort (also known as Golla konda (Telugu: "shepherds' hill"), (Urdu: “round hill”), is a fortified citadel built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty (c. 1512–1687), located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially
                    Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds. The region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless Koh-i-Noor (now owned by the United Kingdom),
                    the blue Hope (United States), the pink Daria-i-Noor (Iran), the white Regent (France), the Dresden Green (Germany), and the colourless Orlov (Russia), Nizam and Jacob (India), as well as the now lost diamonds Florentine Yellow, Akbar
                    Shah and Great Mogul. The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number
                    of different sultanates).

                <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout
                    it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be
                    disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. </p>

                    Although I am an Allu Arjun fan since long and have loved all of his films I have watched, I didn't expect to be surprised this much when I began watching Pushpa: The Rise. The visuals are picturesque, the action choreography is outstanding and the world-building
                    is phenomenal. Although it could've been a bit shorter, director Sukumar has backed his film with enough positives to justify the existence of almost every scene. And Allu Arjun's shockingly outstanding performance proves why he is
                    loved by audiences all over India. Allu Arjun has over the years become synonymous with the action genre, and hence viewers expect quality action from his movies. And gladly, the film has impressed here big time. I really enjoyed the
                    fight scenes a lot, and felt I could have enjoyed them better on the big screen. A lot of gorgeous locales add an adventurous feel to the proceedings. The cinematography, background music and dialogues are fascinating. The amount of
                    tension and suspense, however, in the film's final act is something that takes the film to a whole different level. It has brilliantly depicted director Sukumar's ability to change a film's tone from time to time without any hassle.
                    Allu Arjun has delivered the most outstanding performance of his career. His first best, in my opinion, was in Arya: also directed by Sukumar and a cinematic gem. He has outdone even that and delivered a perfect bang for the buck.
                    The makers of Pushpa: The Rise have taken care of all departments since they understand why and what Allu Arjun fans want from his movies. This is a captivating action flick with lots of fun from start to finish. While a lot of people
                    now tend to believe star-driven films are inching towards extinction, this superstar vehicle with equal mass and class entertainment begs to differ, and succeeds in this mission.
